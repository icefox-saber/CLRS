# Solutions to **Introduction to Algorithms** _Fourth Edition_

![cover](./docs//assets/cover.png)

## Getting Started

This **[website](https://icefox-saber.github.io/CLRS/)** contains nearly complete solutions to the bible textbook - [**Introduction to Algorithms** _Fourth Edition_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-Fourth-edition), published by [Thomas H. Cormen](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/thomas-h-cormen), [Charles E. Leiserson](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/charles-e-leiserson), [Ronald L. Rivest](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/ronald-l-rivest), and [Clifford Stein](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/clifford-stein).

I hope to organize solutions to help people and myself study algorithms. By using [Markdown (.md)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files and [KaTeX](https://katex.org) math library, this page is much more readable on portable devices.

## Motivation

I build this website since I want to share my solution while I am learning algorithms, help others learn algorithms, and want to have conversation with people who use my docs.

Therefore, if any adjustment is needed, please don't hesitate to give me your feedback. You can press the "pencil icon" in the upper right corner to edit the content or [open an issue](https://github.com/icefox-saber/CLRS/issues/new) in [this repository](https://github.com/icefox-saber/CLRS/). Your solution will be rebased after I review it and make some form modifications to your pull request.

Thank you very much, and I hope that everyone will learn algorithms smoothly.

## How I Generate the Website?

I use the static site generator [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) and the beautiful theme [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to build this website.

As for rendering math equations, I use [KaTeX](https://katex.org/), which is fast and beautiful.
