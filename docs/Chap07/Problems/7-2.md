# 7-2 Quicksort with equal element values

> The analysis of the expected running time of randomized quicksort in Section 7.4.2 assumes that all element values are distinct. This problem examines what happens when they are not.
>
> **a**. Suppose that all element values are equal. What is randomized quicksortâ€™s running time in this case?
>
> **b**. The **PARTITION** procedure returns an index $q$ such that each element of $A[p:q-1]$ is less than or equal to $A[q]$ and each element of $A[q+1:r]$ is greater than $A[q]$. Modify the **PARTITION** procedure to produce a procedure **PARTITION'(A,p,r)**, which permutes the elements of $A[p:r]$ and returns two indices $q$ and $t$, where $p\leq q \leq t \leq r$, such that
>
> - all element of $A[q:t]$ are equal,
> - each element of $A[p:q-1]$ is less than $A[q]$, and
> - each element of $A[t+1:r]$ is greater than $A[q]$.
>
> Like **PARTITION**, your **PARTITION**' procedure should take $\Theta(r-p)$ time.
>
> **c**. Modify the **RANDOMIZED-PARTITION** procedure to call **PARTITION**', and name the new procedure **RANDOMIZED-PARTITION**'. Then modify the **QUICKSORT** procedure to produce a procedure **QUICKSORT'(A,p,r)** that calls **RANDOMIZED-PARTITION**' and recurses only on partitions where elements are not known to be equal to each other.
>
> **d**. Using **QUICKSORT**', adjust the analysis in Section 7.4.2 to avoid the assumption that all elements are distinct.
