# 7.3 A randomized version of quicksort

## 7.3-1

> Why do we analyze the expected running time of a randomized algorithm and not its worst-case running time?

For a randomized algorithm, it is highly probable to produce the expected running time, but little probability to produce worst-case running time. For randomized version of quicksort, the probability to produce worst-case running time is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{2^{n}}{n!}\cr
\end{aligned}
$$

> When **RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT** runs, how many calls are made to the random-number generator **RANDOM** in the worst case? How about in the best case? Give your answer in terms of $\Theta$-notation.

In worst case, **RANDOM** will always select the minimum or maximum number, each element will be selected as pivot. The number of calls to **RANDOM** is: $\Theta(n)$.

In best cast, let $F(n)$ be the calls made to **RAMDOM**, $G(n) = \min(F(n))$

$$
\begin{align}
    F(1) = 0\cr
    F(2) = 1\cr
    G(3) = 1\cr
    G(n) = \min(G(k)+G(n-k-1)+1)\cr
    G(n) = 2G((n-1)/2) +1(\text{I guess})\cr
    G(n) = O(n)\cr
\end{align}
$$
